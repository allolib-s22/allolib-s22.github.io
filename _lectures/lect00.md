Notes for Monday 03/26:

Video of [Allosphere Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/joann_kuchera_morin_stunning_data_visualization_in_the_allosphere?language=en)

What will you learn in this course, Why take this course?
* Learn about allolib, because you want to get involved in the Allosphere research group
* Learn about how to synthesize different kinds of sounds
* Compose electronic music
* Explore the math/science/programming of digital audio

Then:
* Demo of Allosphere_Playground
* Video by Vi Hart: What is up with Noises? <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_0DXxNeaQ0>

Basics: 
* Sound (our sense experience of vibrations), music (organized sound)
* Periodic signals: frequency, period, wavelength
* Time Domain / Frequency Domain, Fourier transform
* The basic sine wave (Audacity)
* Making a square wave from sine waves: y = sin(t) + sin(3*t)/3 + sin(5*t)/5 + sin(7*t)/7 + sin(9*t)/9;

Overview of some basic synthesis techniques: 
* Additive (add up some sine waves)
* Subtractive (filter "white/pink/brown" noise down to pull out just particular frequencies)
* Frequency Modulation (start by modulating a sine wave to produce vibrato, then crank up the frequency)
* Physical Modeling (try to model the physics of a plucked string, closed pipe, etc.)
