# Course Description

This course provides an introduction to digital audio through the lens of the software used by the Allosphere Research Group at UC Santa Barbara. (See: <https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group> ). We will learn the basics of music synthesis (e.g. Additive Synthesis, Subtractive Synthesis, FM Synthesis, etc.) by exploring these concepts using the software library used to power the Allosphere at UCSB. If time permits, we may also explore some of the graphics capabilities of the software, but the focus will be on sound.

Accommodations for disabilities
-------------------------------

Students with disabilities may request academic accommodations for exams online through the UCSB Disabled Students Program at http://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu/. Please make your requests for exam accommodations through the online system as early in the quarter as possible to ensure proper arrangement.

Managing stress
---------------

Personal concerns such as stress, anxiety, relationships, depression, cultural differences, can interfere with the ability of students to succeed and thrive. For helpful resources, please contact UCSB Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) at 805-893-4411 or visit http://counseling.sa.ucsb.edu/ .

Responsible scholarship
-----------------------

Honesty and integrity in all academic work is essential for a valuable educational experience.  The Office of Judicial Affairs has policies, tips, and resources for proper citation use, recognizing actions considered to be cheating or other forms of academic theft, and studentsâ€™ responsibilities, available on their website at: http://judicialaffairs.sa.ucsb.edu.  Students are responsible for educating themselves on the policies and to abide by them.

Furthermore, for general academic support, students are encouraged to visit Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) early and often. CLAS offers instructional groups, drop-in tutoring, writing and ESL services, skills workshops and one-on-one consultations. CLAS is located on the third floor of the Student Resource Building, or visit http://clas.sa.ucsb.edu
