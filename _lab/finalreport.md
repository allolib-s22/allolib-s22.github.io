Please prepare a 1-2 page final report in which you summarize your work this quarter.

It doesn't have to be particularly formal.   What I'm looking for are answers to these questions:

* What did you make this quarter, using Allolib?
  - Here, it is helpful if you can link to the repos, files, etc.
  - If you have a summary of your work in the notes repo, you can also link to that.
* What concepts, ideas, skills, did you learn this quarter?
  - Briefly describe each high level idea; you don't have to give a complete accounting of every detail of, for example, what you
    learned about FM Synthesis; it's enough to say something high-level about what you are able to explain, do, produce, etc. that
    you couldn't do before.
  - This is a nice one page summary of the [kinds of words that are helpful when describing learning](https://www.njcu.edu/sites/default/files/docs/2020-09/Behavioral%20Verbs%20for%20Effective%20Learning%20Objectives%202012.pdf)
  - I don't want to go too deep into the concept of "behavioural objectives"; if you are interested, do a web search on that.
  - The main idea is: we can't see inside your head to see what you "know" or "understand".  What we can see is what you can say, do,
    explain, write about, write code to implement, etc.  So try to describe your learning using those kinds of active verbs for 
    things that can be observed.
* How have you demonstrated that learning?
  - This goes to the 'active verb' thing.
  - If you feel you have some important learning you haven't demonstrated yet, you have about a week to try to come up with a way to demonstrate that, in writing, in code, or you can make a video if you'd prefer to demonstrate orally.
* If you were assigning a letter grade to your work, compared with the work you've done in other similar courses, what letter grade would you assign, and why?  
  - It is helpful if you can include a brief description of your understanding of letter grades.
  - You may find it helpful to read this article, linked in the slack: https://www.jessestommel.com/how-to-ungrade/
